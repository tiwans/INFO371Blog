        <p class="ml-3">
        I attended the Center for Studies In Demography & Ecology (CSDE) Lightning Talk & Poster Session on March 9th, 
        which was a seminar about research and their insights about demographic. There was various research topics presented at 
        this seminar that were about various locations, health, and social problems. I focused on a poster regarding fertility rate 
        projections where the individual refined the UN's model for calculating for Total Fertility Rate (TFR) to accommodate 
        the uncertainty of some of the data using the Bayesian hierarchical model. The current model does not take into the fact 
        that some of the countries does not have the data and therefore, the projections are inaccurate. The individual used 
        three TFR and three Bayesian hierarchical models. They presented the model by calculating the projections for 2100.
        </p>
        <p class="ml-3 mb-0">
        They take the uncertainty in the datasets and calculate the bias and measurement of error variances of the model. They 
        take a conditional normal distribution with the mean equaling the TFR plus the bias and error variance. Then trained and 
        test their new model to ensure the projections for the future will be reason. Their model's projections have improved in 
        comparison to the original model that the UN is using. Their prediction intervals are wider than the UN's and found that 
        the uncertainty has improved for the coverage rate.
        </p>
        <p class="ml-3">
        I was unaware of the UN calculating TFR and how they are not taking into consideration the missing or lack of data for 
        some of the countries. The presenter stretches how they were missing almost 0.5 of the countries due to this fact. I 
        think the model has improved based on the presenter's research; however, these countries need assistance on developing 
        processes for recording fertility data. I think this is only the way the model can improve and make more accurate projections. 
        The UN should focus on creating a guideline for recording data for all countries, which the countries need to be compliant with.
        </p>
        <p class="ml-3">
        I think this research is related to risk assessment, and data science courses because there is a gap in the system that needs 
        to be resolved so that machine learning can be leveraged. If each country collects data that the model can use, then the projections 
        for the future will be closely aligned with the actual. I think the uncertainty model created by this team can resolve this issue, but 
        the uncertainty needs to be resolved at the root. 
        </p>
        <p class="ml-3">
        The event was very interesting because you gained an understanding of the varying problems and how models can be used to solve some of them. 
        They had a common solution of creating an equation or model to resolve the problem. They all leveraged statistics to analyze the data that 
        they were using. During this seminar, I realized that statistics was not something that I was interested in, but I enjoy creating visualizations 
        that answer a question for a business.
